# Run a production docker container for the application.
#
# The docker container is cognizant of two environment variables:
#
#   HTTP_PORT for the port of the server application
#   PROD_CONF for the Play production configuration file of the application
#
# These variables are used to provide information about the production 
# deployment environment to the Play application. They are transmitted
# to the container via -e options to the docker run command.
#
# The production config file is created on the host machine and must be 
# mapped into the docker file system. We use the convention that external server
# data for the application is rooted on the host system at the well-known folder:
#
#       /opt/data/boardgame
#
# And that this folder is mapped to a folder of the same absolute name in the 
# container file system. The mapping is done by using the -v option of the
# docker run command.
#

# TODO. Try to redirect output of the container to a mounted volume in the container.
# Then can use docker run -d to create a detatched conatiner.
# And the logs will be on the host file system.
