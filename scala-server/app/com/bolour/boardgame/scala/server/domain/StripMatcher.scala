/**
  * StripMatcher finds the best word match to a given board.
  *
  * A match is the tuple (word, strip) where the word exists in the
  * dictionary and can legally be played onto the strip: that is,
  * the blanks of the strip can be filled by letters in the tray,
  * and all crosswords formed by the playing the word exist in
  * the dictionary.
  *
  * The algorithm first groups the strips of the board by the "value"
  * of a play on them. The value of a strip is supposed to be reflective of the
  * expected added score by playing a word on that strip. So the
  * algorithm checks for matches in decreasing order of strip value,
  * stopping as soon as a match is found.
  *
  * The naive valuation used here initially simply uses the number of
  * blank characters within the strip, in the hope that in general
  * the more characters played to form a word the higher the score.
  * For now, this naive valuation scheme works reasonably well.
  * To experiment with different valuation schemes, sub-class this
  * trait and override the "stripValuation" function.
  *
  * Additionally within each group of equally-valued strips, the strips
  * of the group are further grouped by the number of blanks appearing
  * in each. Then for each sub-group of a given blank-count,
  * all combinations of tray letters of size blank-count are
  * tried against all strips of the sub-group.
