<div style="font-size: 35px; color: #009FFF; text-align: center">Board Game</div>

<p>
A board game in the crossword genre.

<p>
Showcasing Haskell and Scala game servers and a React drag and drop web UI.

<p>
Currently in version 0.9 alpha trial. For modern browsers on the MAC, Linux,
and Windows platforms. Not supported on smart phones and tablets.

<p>
<a href="http://oceanpark.com:6587/boardgame">Check it out!</a>

<p>
Drag and drop letters to form a word connected to an existing board letter
(if any) and click <em>Commit Play</em> to play that word. 

<p>
The application represents the most recent deployment of 
<a href="https://github.com/azadbolour/boardgame">the boardgame open source project</a>.
The project is intended primarily as a test bed for learning and experimentation with different 
languages and framework for application development and deployment. 

<p>
The game's rules may change over time as interesting variations are discovered with
usage.

<h4>Rules</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Points are associated with board locations - not with letters. 

<li>
The assignment of points to board locations varies from game to game.

<li>
A word play accumulates the points of the [new] locations it captures.

<li>
A word play on a non-empty board must contain at least one existing letter.

<li>
A word play on an empty board is unrestricted.

<li>
The played word and any crosswords formed by the play must exist in the
game's dictionary. 

<li>
The machine generates letters for play randomly based on the frequency of 
letters in English lexicon 
(per <a href="http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/353">Oxford Math Center</a>). 
There is no notion of a container of letters getting depleted.

<li>
When no play is possible, a single letter is swapped for another.
A game ends upon 10 consecutive no-plays [swaps]. 

<li>
Games have a time limit of 1 hour. Longer games are considered 
abandoned and are harvested.

</ul>

<h4>Noteworthy</h4>

<p>
You may wish to install a dictionary plugin in your browser to 
easily search for the meanings of words played by the machine.

<p>
Make sure the status field below the board is visible.

<p>
The starting player is chosen at random to be the user or the machine.
There may be a slight hesitation in an initial machine play.

<p>
The board's dimension is configurable through the URL query 
parameter <em>dimension</em>. Valid values are odd numbers
between 5 and 25 inclusive (default 17).

<p>
The game's letter tray capacity is configurable through the URL query
parameter <em>tray-capacity</em> (in the range [3 .. 15],
default 8).

<h4>Issues</h4>

The game's dictionary is based on:

<p>
http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3201/files/CROSSWD.TXT -
<p>
a comprehenve list of common English words.

<p>
But from time to time, you'll run into a common word that is 
not in the dictionary. 

<p>
Please add issues and ideas for improvment (including any missing common words
in the dictionary) to the 
<a href="https://github.com/azadbolour/boardgame/issues">issues list.</a>
